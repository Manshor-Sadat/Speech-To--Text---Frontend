# Speech-to-Text Transcription System

## Overview
A simple app that turns live speech into text. It also:
- Labels each speaker
- Shows timestamps and total call length
- Highlights key words

It has a Python backend (FastAPI) and a desktop app (PyQt5). A React web UI is planned later.

## Features
- **Live transcription:** See text as you speak
- **Speaker labels:** Know who said what
- **Timestamps & duration:** Track time per segment and full call
- **Keyword highlights:** Spot important terms
- **Flexible engines:** Use AssemblyAI or Whisper
- **Database options:** Store results in MongoDB or Qdrant
- **Twilio support (optional):** Transcribe phone calls

## Quick Setup
1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Manshor-Sadat/Speech-To--Text---Frontend.git
   cd Speech-To--Text---Frontend
